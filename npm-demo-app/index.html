    <!-- this is how websites used to make with JS libraries! 
     annoying thing is needing to find and download new versions of libraries
     every time they would update
    <script src="moment.min.js"></script> -->
    <!-- now, no longer have to manually download moment.js from the website,
     I can automatically download and update it using npm, the file will be in
     the node_modules folder -->

    <!-- this still isn't great, bc I need to dig through node_moduels to find
     location of each package and manually include it in my HTML 
     webpack - automates the process of searching node_modules to find packages,
               bundle them, and include it in my HTML -->

    <!-- JS was designed to only run in the browser with no access to the file 
     system of the client's computer for security reasons
     organizing JS code in multiple files required me to load each file with variables
     shared globally -->

    <!-- 
    <script src="node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js"></script>
    <script src="index.js"></script> -->
    <script src="./dist/main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from HTML!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- went from plain HTML and JS to using npm, a package manager to automatically download 3rd party packages
 a webpack/module bundler to create a single script file (node.js require or import statements)
 a babel/transpiler to use future JS features
 a npm scripts/task runner to automate different parts of the build process 
 
 hot reloading -
 real-time linting -
 time-travel debugging - 
 
 there would still be performance issues with the more module files the browser would have to download individually
 (especially as more third-party libraries would be imported) -->
