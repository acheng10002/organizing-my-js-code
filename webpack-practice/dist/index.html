<!-- HtmlWebpackPlugin - tool that helps Webpack bundle HTML 
 no script tag is necessary, HtmlWebpackPlugin automatically adds my output
 bundle as a script tag 
 
 no link tags here
 it's easier to work wilth multiple smaller CSS files that I import in the
 modules they're needed 
 many build tools and more sophisticated bundler configurations will do a 
 lot more to imported CSS than what's here -->
