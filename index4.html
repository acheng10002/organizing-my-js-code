    the other into the same global scope 
    if two.js script tag was put first, I'd get an error, greeting is not defined 
    
    even if I use multiple JS files, they will end up sharing the same global scope,
    so my top-level variables are not safe!

  <!--  entry point - single file link JS files to my HTML 
    to use the export declaration in a source file, the file must be interpreted by
    the runtime as a module by being imported by another module, or by modifying the
    script tag below -->
  <script src="two.js" type="module"></script>
