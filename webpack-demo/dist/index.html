<!-- Basic Setup
     I need to adjust my package.json file to make sure I mark my package as private, and removing the main entry
     there are implicit dependencies between the <script> tags
     index.js file depends on lodash being included in the page before it runs 
     index.js never explicitly declared a need for lodash; it assumes the global varible _ exists 

     installed webpack using npm,
     set up a simple project that required an external library (lodash) using a simple script tag
     this is not ideal; a webpack should be used to accomplish this
    
     Modules
     import and export statements have been standarized in ES2015 
     webpack actually transpiles the code so that older browsers can also run it 
     besidesd import and export, webpack supports other module syntaxes, Module API
     webpack will not alter any code other than import and export statements 
     if I am using other ES2015 features, I need to use a transpiler such as Babel via webpack's loader system 
    
     Using a Configuration
     as of version 4, webpack doesn't require any configuration, but most projects will need a more complex setup, which is why webpack supports a configuration file 
     --config option is used, but I can pass a configuration of any name 
        this will be useful for more complex configurations that need to be split into multiple files 
     a configuration files allows far more flexibility than CLI usage
        I can specify loader ryles, plugins, resolve options and many other enhancements 
     src - my source directory
           where I write all of the code that webpack is going to bundle up for me
     when webpack runs, it goes through all of my files, 
     starting at any entry points I give it,
     looks for any import statements,
     and then compiles all of the code I need to run my site into a single file per entry point inside of the dist (short for distribution) folder
     my example has a single entry point, /src/index.js
     its output file is the compiled version, dist/main.js
    
     NPM Scripts
     adjust package.json by adding an npm script 
     npm run build command can be used in place of the npx command 
     within scripts, I can reference locally installed npm packages by name, the same way I did with npx 
     this convention is the standard in most npm-based projects because it allows all contributors to use the same set of common scripts 
     custom parameters can be passed to webpack by adding two dashes between the npm run biuld command and my parameters
     e.g. npm run build -- --color 
    
     warning: do not compile untrusted code with webpack
        it could lead to execution of malicious code on my computer, remote servers, or in the browsers of the end users of my application -->
